But now it is your turn to try to do what none have ever managed to accomplish before you: defeat the dreaded mob syndicate. They have taken over the dungeons the world's people call home, and you have just committed to liberate the people. How <s>badly will you fail</s> amazingly will you succeed?</h3>
